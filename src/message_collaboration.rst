You will be correcting the assignments of

%(correcting_names)s
	

You now have access to push and pull to their repositories. You should make a temporary
directory and execute


.. code-block:: 
    :language: bash

%(get_repos)s


With all the repositories on your computer you are ready to start correcting and examining the work.
In addition to reading the code you should run all programs and check the output. 
Pay special attention to the parts of the program where the method is implemented. 
When you give feedback you should say something about these four questions:

* Is the program easy to read and understand? 
    * Descriptive variable names?
    * Sufficient amount of comments?
* Does the program solve the problem?
* Is it easy to understand how to run the program?
* Is the implementation verified?
* Is the report well written?
    * Clear language and logic
    * Few typos

If you can answer yes on four of these five points then the exersice is approved.
The feedback is given by uploading a file PASSED_YES or PASSED_NO. In this file
you should write comments on each point.
