TODO:

(D) is development, is just an idea.

- Generate stats: commits, comments, attendence ect.
- Make collaboration work with groups of one.
- Change to OAuth
- Check if there is an Attendance repository in the classrom, if not create one
- Look for potential speed ups, adding 40 students takes too long.
- Make a option for sending emails or not.
- Need a more robust way of handling special characters in student.py
- Use s = request.Session() and set s.auth = auth, and then use s.put, s.get and
  so on, is this faster?
- Add a test for number of teams, now max is 100, need to iterate over each page.
- The admin user is added to every new team, this is a bug.
- For people with the same firstname it doesn't change the repo name.
