TODO:

(D) is development, is just an idea.

- Generate stats: commits, comments, attendence ect.
- Make collaboration work with groups of one.
- Change to OAuth
- Check if there is an Attendance repository in the classrom, if not create one
- Make a option for sending emails or not.
- Need a more robust way of handling special characters in student.py
- The admin user is added to every new team, this is a bug.

Potential speed up:
- Use s = request.Session() and set s.auth = auth, and then use s.put, s.get and
  so on, is this faster?
- Keep the server open in Email and close when done.
