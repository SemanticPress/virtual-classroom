On Tuesday, November 4th, the fourth mandatory group session will take place. We have 
registered that you have attended and passed two sessions out of three so far. Hence
you are lacking one session to pass. 

There are only two sessions left including the one on Tuesday, so make sure
that you have enough sessions passed before the end of the semester.
