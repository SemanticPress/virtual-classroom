======= Automatic operation of GitHub and Bitbucket =======



!bsummary Conclusions
 * Drop fork and pull, use clone and push with a course-specific account
 * Need to describe in detail "how to operate multiple acounts": "http://dbushell.com/2013/01/27/multiple-accounts-and-ssh-keys/" as the lecturer and TA has to do that
 * Do not use Python wrappers - use the REST APIs directly from
   home-made Python code, because the APIs are much better documented
   than the Python wrappers.
 * Use "Requests": "http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html"
   library in Python
!esummary

Further work:

 * Instructor must be able to
  * give one assessment group access to another group's exercise
  * give two students access to two individual exercises, or maybe it is
    sufficient to have one student with access to one exercises and then
    they sit together and look at the same screen
  * automate this process of pairing students or groups and giving
    them read/write access (for 3331 and 5620) - the latter thing is easy if
    the instructor has admin access and can use REST API to set and remove
    new accesses
 * First, check out organization accounts and how github thinks about classroom use:
  * "GitHub goes to school": "https://github.com/blog/1775-github-goes-to-school", see also URL: "https://education.github.com/"
  * "GitHub doc for using Git in the classroom": "https://education.github.com/guide" (GitHub has thought about this so understand their model first)
  * "Access permissions to GitHub accounts": "https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-the-different-access-permissions"
  * "Employing Git in the classroom": "http://www.academia.edu/5968989/Employing_Git_in_the_Classroom" (Very similar set-up to INF5620)
  * "Interesting new method for INF5620": "http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2013/Program/viewAcceptedProposal.pdf?sessionType=paper&sessionNumber=257"
  * "Application to exams": "http://lfborjas.com/2010/10/30/git-classroom-exams.html"
  * "OpenShift used in teaching": "https://www.openshift.com/blogs/openshift-goes-to-school-how-a-little-automation-goes-a-long-way-in-the-classroom"

===== GitHub =====

 * Intro: URL: "http://developer.github.com/guides/getting-started/"
 * "Python example using reskit": "http://agrimmsreality.blogspot.no/2012/05/sampling-github-api-v3-in-python.html"
 * "All about OAuth authorization from Python": "http://goodcode.io/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/OAuth-edited.pdf"

=== What we want to do ===

 o Fork a repo URL: "http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/forks/#create-a-fork"
 o Give TAs full rights to the forked repo URL: "http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#add-collaborator"
 o Create a pull request URL: "https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#create-a-pull-request", see "this script": "http://pastebin.com/F9n3nPuu"

The rest is plain git commands from the OS.

!bbox
A simpler scheme is to just clone and push, but the students must then
give access to the private repo to both the lecturer and the teaching
assistant.
!ebox

Or can the lecturer clone and then copy the repo to share it with the TA?
What about a course specific bitbucket account? Must then learn how to
operate multiple accounts:
URL: "http://dbushell.com/2013/01/27/multiple-accounts-and-ssh-keys/".
With just clone and push rather than fork and pull, it all becomes easier
to automate!

===== Bitbucket =====

Read the "intro": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Use+the+Bitbucket+REST+APIs" first.

 * "Command-line tool from Atlassian to operate Bitbucket": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/stash-command-line-tools" (can do pull request)
 * "Another, Python-based command-line tool": "https://bitbucket.org/zhemao/bitbucket-cli" (look at the code, but it's easier to do this directly with the API)
 * "Python access to API": "https://github.com/Sheeprider/BitBucket-api"
   but cannot do fork, or add collaborator (or maybe *service* module can add hook for that?)
 * Bitbucket REST API:
   * "Set access permissions": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/privileges+Endpoint#privilegesEndpoint-PUTanewprivilege"
   * "Invite users to a repo": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/invitations+Endpoint"
   * "Fork or clone a repo": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/repository+Resource+1.0#repositoryResource1.0-POSTanewfork", see also "this": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/repository+Resource" and "this": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11640035/using-bitbuckets-api-to-fork-a-repository"

=== What we want to do ===

 * "Access": "https://bitbucket-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html"
 * "Overview": "https://bitbucket-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest/bitbucket.html"
 * "Fork": "https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/repository+Resource+1.0#repositoryResource1.0-POSTanewfork" (googling indicates this is not straightforward)

Seems that github is best for what I want.
